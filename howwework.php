<h1>How sub contracted staff work with remote staff international clients:</h1>
<p>At Remote Staff we understand that distance has become irrelevant when it comes to working in the 21st century, thanks mainly to Remote Staff's technologies and HR services. Today, regardless if you're working from a home office location half way around the world, you will find working from home offers much the same career growth and opportunities traditionally found only within an office environment.</p> 

<!--<p>The stress and pressures you might find working from an office will still be noticeable when working from home because the professional expectations and responsibilities in doing the job is still the same, regardless of where you are working from. Remote Staff has developed a system where international clients could depend and rely on staff to work remotely just like they are an extension of their own local team.</p> -->

<h3><strong>Below are a list of expectations to make working from home a professional experience for<br />
  both clients and staff. Also learn more about how Remote Staff negotiates contractor wages.</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Log online to the Remote Staff Sub Con Portal and on Skype...and you�re officially present for the day. It's that simple, your commute time is only a few seconds walking from your bedroom to your private home office desk;</li>

<li>You will be working on a fixed structured schedule and expected to start working on particular start and finish time each day. If you will be late (for any reason), you need to inform the Client-Staff Relations Officer on-duty at least one hour before start of your shift, either via SMS, phone call or via e-mail</li>

<li>You will need to login to the Remote Staff online timesheet and Remote Staff Screen Capture system. We use the timesheets and screen shots as a main reference for organizing payroll; </li>

<li>If you will be absent (for whatever reason), you need to inform Client-Staff Relations Officer on-duty at least two hours before start of your shift, either via SMS, phone call or via e-mail;</li>

<li>You will be using a number of online communication tools like Skype and other tools to transfer large files, share your screen for meetings and online collaborations tools. If you don�t know already, you will soon find out that you could work just as well from a remote location as you might by working from an office location using many online management and communication tools. </li>

<li>Overtime you will be such a master of using the many online tools that you would find working online faster, smarter and better way to get your work and job done compared to any face to face meetings in an office;</li>

<li>If you require assistance on any work or cultural issues with your client, you could contact any of the Remote Staff Client-Staff relations Officer on-duty. At Remote Staff, our job is to foster lasting relationships between you and our clients;</li>

<li>You are allowed two 10-minute quick breaks (coffee-break) and a one-hour lunch break every day if needed; (for full time contracts only)</li>

<li>Unlike typical office setups, working from home provides you the luxury of being able to reconnect with your family (e.g. wife, kids, etc.) during your coffee breaks or lunch break which results in better work-life balance. Please note: you should educate those living with you that they are not to approach of bother you for anything during working hours. This discipline is needed so your focus on the job during working hours;</li>

<li>Any questions with regards to attendance compliance, systems and pay will be addressed directly to the Staff Client Relations Officer;</li>

<li>Make sure your private room (or space) provides you optimum and undivided focus so that you can get your assigned tasks done in time. Keep noise pollution at a minimal or nonexistent (e.g. baby crying on the background, dogs barking and motor noises).</li>

<ul>

<li>Working from home means quite literally, your internet connection and working computer is your lifeline to the job, so always check your equipment and your internet connection daily. You will need 1.0mbps download and 0.35mbps upload internet connection speed to maintain a quality work from home experience;</li>

<li>Remote Staff works on a no work, no pay policy. So, for every absence (or tardiness), you will receive deductions on your monthly pay; You are only paid for the hours and days you worked but this doesn�t mean that you can only work when you want to. To sustain a longer and lasting work from home career and relationship with our clients you are expected to have a very good work attendance;</li>

<li>Contractors who work with Australian clients need to be online around 6 AM or 7 AM ,UK clients between 4 PM or 5 PM and for US clients (depending on East- or West-coast location and also daylight savings time adjustments), will be on nightshift from 9pm or midnight starting times;</li>

<li>As soon as you have login to the Remote Staff Sub Con Portal, you can start working. The portal has a built-in function that captures screenshots of your computer activity. This function is not intended to snoop on you, but more specifically intended to provide transparency to the client , to better manage your daily tasks efficiently and prove to clients you are in fact working;</li>

<li>This portal will also ask you to update and fill the activity tracker every 20 to 30 minutes. The activity tracker note summary will be sent to the client at the end of the working hours. This will give the client a general and overall idea of what has been accomplished for the day.</li>

<li>For some night shift contractors, some international clients may require use of web cam screenshots so to confirm that you are in fact working in a peak condition and not half asleep;</li>

<li>Effective and instant communication helps build trust in any working relationship, for this reason we have a Skype 3 minute response rule in place to facilitate both client and staff relationships are establish and work momentum is achieved;</li>

<li>You will be working directly with the client and will not be project managed by Remote Staff. This means that any input or feedback with regards to the way you work or how you think you should be does the job etc. should be communicated directly with the client. This is a very important step towards developing a good working relationship with your client and to be able to manage your clients professional expectations they may have with you regarding the job;</li>

<li>Ensure that your work resources are in place and functional before the beginning of any working day because issues like problematic internet connections, power outages and computer crashes puts your working relationship with the client at risk. As a sub contractor, you're expected to find ways to manage your home work environment</li>

<li>The stress and pressures you might find working from an office will still be noticeable when working from home because the professional expectations and responsibilities in doing the job is still the same, regardless of where you are working from;</li>
