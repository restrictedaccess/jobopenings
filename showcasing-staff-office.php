<p>Charisse is considered as a personal/executive assistant for her client Steve.  She monitors emails, serves as the company's receptionist and is very effective in keeping the communication open between the company and the clients.  Her role has emphasized the importance of keeping constant communication with members of her client's database.  Her client has learned to depend on her so much that if she's not on top of things with her client's appointments, the client would have a hard time catching up with his day.  At times when her client would give her tasks beyond her daily to-dos, the client is often surprised when she delivers in a timely manner.  Steve is very grateful that Remote Staff found his perfect assistant for him.</p></div>
