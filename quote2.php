    <td class="side"><p>&#8220;Globalization is not something we can hold off 
        or turn off&#8230;.. it is the economic equivalent of a force of nature, 
        like wind or water.&#8221; <strong>Bill Clinton</strong></p>
      <p>&#8216;If you deprive yourself of outsourcing and your competitors do 
        not, you&#8217;re putting yourself out of business.&#8221; <strong>Lee 
        Kuan Yew </strong></p>
      <p>&quot;Outsourcing and globalization allows companies to reduce costs, 
        benefits consumers with lower cost goods and services, causes economic 
        expansion that reduces unemployment, and increases productivity and job 
        creation.&quot; <strong>Larry Elder </strong></p>
      <p>&quot;This is a very exciting time in the world of information. It's 
        not just that the personal computer has come along as a great tool. The 
        whole pace of business is moving faster. Globalization is forcing companies 
        to do things in new ways.&quot; <strong>Bill Gates</strong></p>
      <p>&quot;Nobel Prize-winning economist Dr. Lawrence R. Klein, the founder 
        of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, co-authored a study that 
        showed how global outsourcing actually creates more jobs and increases 
        wages, at least for IT workers. The study found that outsourcing helped 
        companies be more competitive and more productive. That means they make 
        more money, which means they funnel more into the economy, thereby, creating 
        more jobs&quot; <strong>Donald J Trump</strong></p>
      <p>&quot;Believe me, the [recent] trend toward outsourcing has very little 
        to do with economizing and a great deal to do with quality.&quot; <strong>Peter 
        Drucker</strong>, Distinguished management professor.</p>
      <p>&quot;Globalization has changed us into a company that searches the world, 
        not just to sell or to source, but to find intellectual capital - the 
        world's best talents and greatest ideas.&quot; <strong>Jack Welch</strong></p>
      <p>&quot;As a business manager, you need to take a hard look at your core 
        competencies. Revisit the areas of your company that aren't directly involved 
        in those competencies, and consider whether Web technologies can enable 
        you to spin off those tasks. Let another company take over the management 
        responsibilities for that work, and use modern communication technology 
        to work closely with the people.&#8221; <strong>Bill Gates</strong> <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Accordingly, globalization is not only something that will concern 
        and threaten us in the future, but something that is taking place in the 
        present and to which we must first open our eyes.&quot; <strong>Ulrich 
        Beck </strong></p>
