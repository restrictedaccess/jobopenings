		<p>Remote Staff business model has been built on the knowledge that having all work done from an office didn't necessarily add extra value to the quality of work, particularly with those that don't rely heavily on constant collaboration between coworkers or when the staff count is small. Many of these job functions could have just as easily been completed from home and nobody would be the wiser for it and this is why our core business model is focused at offering home base staffing solutions.<br /><br />
		But as Remote Staff and our clients continue to grow we need to adapt to the changes brought about by our success by opening the new office.  After 4 years of working 100% in the virtual work landscape we found it refreshing to be able to work from an office. We have clearly notice how much faster strategically as a team we have able to move as well as get everyone working together in sync has been generally much easier to accomplish.</p>
       <p>As we grow in staff numbers it has become much easier to drive larger teams all in the same direction from an office, but smaller teams could easily be managed remotely. As a result, we see value in both working environments depending on the size of your operation and depending on the number of departments within your business. Our own experience working with Remote contractors in a virtual setting has demonstrated clearly how both these working environments could be best applied as your business grows in size.</p>
        <p>We would like to share with you some of the milestones that we have realized in benefiting from the virtual and office set ups. Please see below 7 ways in how we have applied the benefits of both working environments. We hope this information will help you be better informed to make the right decision in work virtually or office-based with your team.</p>

			<p>As we grow beyond a team of 400 and towards our goal of 1,000 contractors, we have seen and experienced various management scenarios and situations that have allowed us to clearly identify where we are strongest and where there was room for improvement. Issues unique to our virtual setup were discovered, such as the challenges to the overall effectiveness of communication and collaboration from departments with teams larger than fifteen members. This prompted the decision to have the management and support team work from the office while other departments remain to continue working from their own home-based environments. <br />

This new process is designed to ensure that clients get the very best start with their new Remote Staff contractors.<br /><br />
		At the office, we will teach the new hires our proven work techniques and best remote staffing practices unique to the Philippines. Our communication managers will be around to bring the new staff up to speed and help both you and your staff become effective working as a true remote team.

		<p>Providing Filipinos with an opportunity to work professionally from home has always been our mission at Remote Staff. Unlike in other parts of the world where public  vehicles arrive and depart at specific schedules, drivers of Philippine buses  and jeepneys wait until their vehicles are filled to capacity before they  depart, thereby turning what would have been a 30-minute ride into a two hour  commute. Also people are exposed to pollution and consistently hot weather on top of crazy commuting rules and 3rd world infrastructure. We hope you could see why offering the chance to work from home is such a powerful motivations for the Filipino people and why it has helped us attract so many quality staff over the years.</p>
		<p align="left"><img src="http://remotestaff.com.au/images/creading.jpg" id="crm6" style="cursor:pointer;" onClick="this.style.display='none'; document.getElementById('divguarantee').style.display = 'block';"align="left" /></p></div>
		
       <div id="divguarantee">
	   		<p>Without a doubt we know we are making a tremendous difference to over 400 people's lives. The inconveniences associated with working from an office setting across the Philippines results in a large number of staff coming in at least 2 days a week completely tired and not in the best condition to work. 
 
Another major point as to why we retain our focus in contracting home-based staff even though we now have an office is because the Philippine labor is roughly 70% more cost-effective compared to that of western countries, but office rental cost were slightly lower than in the U.S or even Australia. And even more surprising is that the bills associated with the office cost could in many cases be higher such as power bills. For Remote Staff, this means having staff working exclusively from an office would affect our ability to offer globally competitive staff prices our clients have enjoyed from us for so long.

All these elements such as perfect work-life balance found when working from home,  higher job satisfaction and increased productivity have resulted in very dedicated staff we offer to our clients over the many years. In fact some of the first people we have placed to work with our clients are still remaining loyal three and a half years later, demonstrating how strong our retention rates are with home-based staffing.
