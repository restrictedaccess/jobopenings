<h2>Advantages of Working From Home:</h2>
<ol>   
<li><strong>You can work just as professionally and have the same kind of career growth, challenges and responsibilities you can expect from any other role.</strong>  <br />
  Distance and your actual geographical location is irrelevant when you work with Remote Staff.  With our work-at-home setup, we make it possible for you to still build a professional career, while still being a part of an international employer's local team.</li>

<li><strong>You don't need to commute anymore to work.  No more rush hour traffic and pollution. </strong><br />
  You can jump-start your day by making it a habit to wake up at least 10-15 minutes before your working schedule, log online to the Think Innovations Control Panel and on Skype...and you’re officially present for the day. It's that simple. Contractors who work with Australian clients need to be online around 6 AM or 7 AM.  If with UK clients, then 4 PM or 5 PM.  For US clients (depending on East- or West-coast location and also daylight savings time adjustments), then on night-shift.</li>

<li><strong>You have the most ideal working environment ever, i.e. your home.</strong> You don't need to be in a stereotypical office to do a good day's work.  You can get undivided focus and you can get tasks done from a private space in your home just as productively as from an office cubicle.  Congested cubicles, office distractions and annoying co-workers become a thing of the past when you work from the comforts of your own home.</li>

<li><strong>You can achieve better work-life balance and have more time to deal with personal matters. <br />
</strong>Unlike normal office setups, working from home means no time wasted on daily commuting and the convenience to be with your loved ones easily.  Now, you can manage your energy and time much better, and quality time with your wife or kids is possible with the luxury of being able to reconnect with them during your coffee breaks or lunch break.</li>
 
<li><strong>You can save more money (i.e. reduce your monthly expenses up to 20%). </strong><br />
  You can increase your income when you can save on costs like your daily commute to the office, office meals and uniforms.  Working from home lets you cut these expenses and manage your finances better.</li>
</ol>
