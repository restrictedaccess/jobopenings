<p>This policy (together with our terms of use [See TERMS OF USE Section] and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

<p><strong>Information we may collect from you</strong></p>

<p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site www.remotestaff.com.au (our site). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services.

<p><strong>Where we store your personal data</strong></p>

<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the Philippines and Australia. It may also be processed by staff who work for us or for one of our contractors.
