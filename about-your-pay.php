<p align="justify">Contractor's wages can only be negotiated in the initial interview process of hire and must be agreed to and accepted before you commit to Remote Staff as an independent contractor and sign your contract. This is important because we will start marketing you at this agreed to price point and client will be making decisions to hire you because of that price point. You cannot renegotiate the terms of your contract after the interview process especially once commencing work for a client because it is a deal breaker. Imagine buying a product expecting to pay $1 and getting to the check out and finding it to cost $1.50. However, after six months of continued work for a client you will be given a review which will give you the chance to put forward your case to renegotiate your wages, if you can demonstrate you are adding above and beyond value to your job. This does not guarantee you a pay increase because performing a good job is the minimum that Remote Staff expects of our contractors. In saying this, Remote Staff has witnessed that some clients will give bonuses and pay increases to staff who are continually performing to a high standard. In addition to your 6month review if you have worked for one whole year with the same client you will be entitled to a 5% pay increase only if you have not received any pay increases during this year. <br>

		  All wages for contractors working for Remote Staff are calculated using real Filipino market labour rates. We do not pay inflated western market rates you may find on freelancing project-based type of work which are unrealistic and non competitive in the global landscape. Just like in the hotel industry, rates for rooms differ from a day rate, to a weekly rate, to a monthly rate and to a yearly rate. Unlike freelancers or project-based workers who only deal with short-term projects, Remote Staff only deal with long term work based on part-time or fulltime positions, therefore our pay rates are calculated on real Filipino market labour rates. If your hourly rates are too high you will out position yourself in the competitive global labour market, which will also disable the ability for Remote Staff to market you as a candidate.<br>
		  At present Remote Staff has hundreds of staff that are contracted out to clients at Filipino Labour market rates and these are the rates that Remote Staff pay contractors.&nbsp;<br>

	      For Remote Staff to run a successful global business we need to add our fixed margins on top of your wages. Our margins we offer to clients are fixed and do not differentiate between wages paid for your skill level and experience. What is important to understand is that these fixed margins are essential to how we survive as a labour hire company and without them we would not be able to attract new clients, offer you opportunities and provide the services that are expected of us by the client.<br>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>These margins contribute to covering the costs of some of the following:</strong></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left:0px;"><br>
In addition to covering these costs of the services we provide is the fact that Remote Staff has spent millions of dollars from its inception to the current day and it is important that they to have a return of investment to ensure Remote Staff is a financially sustainable and successful company that can continue to operate as a stable company that home based professionals can work from. <br>
	    All these reasons combined require Remote Staff to add fixed margins to the cost of your wages and we hope that you understand and respect these facts. Just because we are a foreign company dealing in Labour hire BPO industries does not mean we will pay unrealistic rates as this would jeopardise the foundations of what has helped to make Remote Staff a competitively priced staffing solution to so many of it's clients and inturn has helped prospective candidates to achieve a long lasting career as a home based professional.
