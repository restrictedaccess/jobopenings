<h3>Is the quality of work done by offshore creative staff good enough?</h3>
<p>We find fantastic work quality in creative job roles like web designers, drafts people, architects, illustrators and finished artists. However, we find the labour talent pool in the Philippines for graphic designers is of a lower standard. This doesn’t mean that we can’t find good quality graphic designers, we can, it is just that they are more difficult to come by and is sometimes not up to western graphic design standards.</p>

<h3>Is the quality of work done by offshore Telemarketing staff good enough?</h3>
<p>Telemarketing is not a preferred career choice for many local Australians. Often when you place job ads on seek, you get few enquires. Students and travellers are often the only applicants willing to do this line of work.</p>

<p>The Philippines is emerging to be the global choice with Telemarketing because many people in the Philippines treat outbound and inbound telemarketing roles as a career move and are committed in doing whatever it takes to get the job done right. We find many telemarketers in the market place who have years of experience with American & Australian people.</p>

<p>You will find good results using telemarketers from the Philippines. Many people in the market place are eager to respond to email or phone enquiries, provide technical and/or customer support, up-sell, cross-sell other products, transfer phone calls to appropriate departments after qualifying the call, take care of account and billing enquiries, market a product or a service, sell a product or a service over the phone, appointment-setting and market research.</p>

<h3>Can I really trust offshore staff?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can. At Remote Staff, we have created systems to help build trust. This is achieved with our invoice system. Clients pay one month in advance and the offshore staff get paid one month in the rear only after they have satisfied the job requirements. Trust is also formed with communications; we require offshore staff to be in contact with us at all times. If they do not show up to work for some reason, we must be informed about it. Our HR manager will always be in touch with your offshore staff.</p>

<p>We also have a 3-minute Skype chat rule. Any time you use instant Skype chat messenger services, offshore staff have to respond to your online communications within 3 minutes. We found as long as communication is instant, trust is built. We also give offshore staff local Australian phone numbers for those clients that want to be able to pick up the phone and call them.</p>

<p>But it’s the Remote Staff system that really helps you build trust with the use of the screen snapshots every 5 minutes. This will help you monitor their daily work flow activities as well as help manage them. In addition to that, you will be able to see their online time sheets including when they start, finish and take lunch.</p>

<p>Also, we have a full time HR manager you can contact any time. Her job is to confirm your staff are online and on-time working.</p>

<h3>Will offshore staff working from home do less work and take longer to get a job done compared with staff working in an office?</h3>
<p>In 90% of cases, we find offshore staff about to keep productivity levels high when working from home. Offshore staff working from home is a preferred choice for many applicants because they get to spend more time at home and can avoid the heavy pollution and massive traffic jams. Remote Staff working from home start their work day fresh. We find by the end of the day staffs are not as tired which increases their productivity levels for you compared to staff working from one of the offices.</p>

<p>In some cases, you will find work from home production can drop by 40% simply because some offshore staff are just not able to adjust with the idea of working from home. They get distracted by family and friends and other things. It’s not a problem if this happens because it would be evident to you as the client and our HR manager in the first week or two. In these cases, we will replace your staff member right away. Our experiences suggest this happens only 10% of the time.</p>

<p>If you don’t want staff working from home, we have 250 office seats available to lease out at $400 per month. Often, having staff working from an office is a good idea when you have a team of 20+ staff. One key benefit in using offshore staff to work from an office is with the reliable power and internet connection. We do have all offshore staff set up working from home with broadband ADSL internet connection. When staff work at home, sometimes you will find blackouts or simple internet drop outs occur once every few weeks. Having staff in an office will prevent this from happening.</p>

<h3>Will they be effective, efficient and functional for my business?</h3>
<p>Yes, they can be just like a local staff member if you are prepared to train and work with your remote staff in the initial stages of employment and the results will speak for themselves in no time. Please note, using offshore staff to work remotely for you will never be a perfect, risk free, secure unconditional satisfaction guaranteed type of experience. It just isn’t. However, once you have the remote staff working the way you want them to you will be pleasantly surprised at just how much extra leverage you and your team can get with the use of offshore staff working for your business remotely.</p>

<h3>Will using offshore staff be a negative reflection of my business; is this something that is very Un-Australian?</h3>
<p>At first glance, it’s easy to see outsourcing as taking local jobs away from Australians but outsourcing and using offshore staff isn’t about that. Remote Staff is about adding new productivity and capabilities for businesses that may not have been able to achieve such capacities by employing just locally. It’s about strengthening and making local businesses competitive in the global market place. Remote Staff often helps businesses get stronger and in turn establishes new employment opportunities locally.</p>

<p>At Think Innovations, we speak with lots of Australian businesses about using Remote Staff and find many Australian companies have been outsourcing and using offshore staff in some way. It’s not just large corporations using offshore staff as a competitive advantage, solo entrepreneurs and consultants are now using this new global trend.</p>

<p>Australians are right now in contact with offshore staff in their everyday lives, and it’s becoming more and more culturally acceptable to get a call from someone offshore about their Optus phone bills, internet connections with Dodo or Citibank credit cards. All of these large companies use offshore staff located in the Philippines to increase their competitive advantages.</p>

<h3>Is the quality of work done by offshore IT staff good enough?</h3>
<p>Quality is very good with IT web developers. We find in many cases you can access more specialised and more experienced talented web developers with HTML, asp.net, PhP, MySql and MsSql and some offshore staff could very well be more advanced than some of your local staff. We have found some of our clients with in-house IT staff at $80k are not as advanced as the offshore staff working remotely for $17,000 per year. This happens on a number of occasions.</p>

<h3>Is the quality of work done by offshore Marketing staff good enough?</h3>
<p>We have great success with Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) staff. Although the market is not flooded with SEOs, the people we have access and experience have proven to be able to do quality work. Finding Search Engine Marketing (SEM) staff can be more challenging. This is because the socio-economic restraints in the Philippines restrict people from placing advertisements on Google AdWords. This restricts the quantity of offshore staff available with this type of experience.</p>
<p>We have no problem finding link builders, bloggers, directory and article submissions, online bookmarking and other offshore staff who know how to marketer using social networking skills online.</p>
<p>The market has a good standard of English writers; we have no problem finding article & product writers, press release or website review writers, writers to do transcriptions and online research.</p>


<h3>Will I be able to manage and work with a remote team like I could work with my local staff?</h3>
<p>Typically, we would often hire someone new and leave it up to them to get the job done. As employers, all we care about are the results. Often, this approach doesn’t work as well when starting out with offshore staff because having staff work remotely from you can create disassociation in their first few weeks. They are still learning your business and discovering how your business operates.</p>

<p>Offshore staff are very good at following directions. It is important when working with offshore staff to provide instructions clearly. This will enable your offshore staff to get the job done accurately. We recommend you use verbal, written and remote screen share to show and demonstrate the job and work requirements you want done. It’s important to make your remote staff feel as if they are part of your local team. If possible having them part of meetings using technology will increase their sense of being part of your team. We find commitment, morale and quality of work is higher when this occurs.</p>

<p>Thanks to technology, working with offshore staff is like having them just down the hall in your office. With screen share technology, you can show your offshore staff what you have on your computer screen, making it easy to communicate when showing or explaining tasks. With soft phones, you can have an international phone number to call your offshore staff at a local call cost. With Remote Staff tools such as Google docs, sharing documents and keeping in touch with workflows and TO DO list is easy. Instant messenger services with Skype helps keep communication constant and live. In addition, you will be able to see your Remote Staffs computer screen every 5 minutes, making it easy to see the flow of work as it happens.</p>

<h3>Will I get the flexibility and commitment from the offshore staff?</h3>
<p>Yes. Offshore staff are eager and driven to learn and work with foreign companies because they find it more prestigious and see it as a good career move. Working with international employers also gives them a variety of experiences and a more challenging working and learning experience which is very much valued.</p>

<p>What we have found is if a small bonus of $25 is given, you will sometimes manage to get 15 hour work days from some staff. Try achieving that with local in house staff!</p>

<p><strong>Please note: </strong>no bonuses are to be offered directly to offshore staff, even though they are dedicated to work with you directly, you will need to submit bonus and overtime requests through to the Think Innovations Remote Staff team located in Australia.</p>

<h3>Will the job get done to the standards I need?</h3>
<p>It’s difficult to generalize, but we found that it depends on the person we hire for you. Our success rate at the moment is 85% that the person our recruitment and HR team select for you will be an asset, as long as a bit of training is offered when starting out and clear expectations are set. To protect you from this concern, Remote Staff offers you a candidate replacement as many times as you like over the first month or two, giving you the client, the best odds in finding the right remote staff to get the job done to your expectations.</p>

<h3>Is their English good enough?</h3>
<p>Yes, the staff's English are fluent enough for them to be effective, efficient and functional on whatever position they’ll be hired for. We only hire staff that have fully functional spoken and written English. More often than not, conversing with Filipinos in English is easier than conversing with many people of non-Indigenous English speaking countries. This is due to the fact that Filipinos have formally learnt English at schools as it is the country’s co-official language. School books are written in English and Hollywood movies are never translated nor subtitled in their local language.</p>

<p>If there is a language barrier issue, it may be more to do with accent rather than English speaking abilities. Depending on the job role and your requirements, we will seek out those who can speak with a neutral accent. The Remote Staff have a slight American accent..</p>

<h3>Will they be able to work well independently?</h3>
<p>Yes. Micromanaging is neither needed nor encouraged, and just like any local staff member, assistance on the first 2 weeks will be necessary. You need to give them a week or two to adjust to the nature of your business or industry and give as much product information as you can to help them get started with you. The more the staff understand your business, the more they will be able to have some foresight and be able to see the full depth in the job that might be needed.</p>

<h3>Are they trustworthy individuals we can rely on?</h3>
<p>Trust is on the top list of the values we adhere to. We assess and guide all the staff we hire to share these values. We have legal representation in the Philippines and a fund set aside to enforce our legally binding contractual agreements that all offshore staff agree and sign before commencement of work. Remote Staff values trust and we demonstrate this by legally protecting your proprietary confidentiality and intellectual property.</p>
