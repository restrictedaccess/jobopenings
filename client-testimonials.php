  </strong><br />
  Small businesses are starting to take advantage of cheap overseas labour by outsourcing work such as marketing, web design and office administration. Budding entrepreneurs say that thanks to the internet, they have been able to source white collar workers from overseas at a significantly lower cost than in Australia.</p>

<p>“RemoteStaff.com.au searched and found me an offshore professional assistant to work remotely with me, who met my criteria based on my job description I gave to them. I can tell you it was the best thing I have done. Now my remotestaff assistant puts my videos live on the website, does my SEO work on the website and is teaching me things along the way as well. All my websites, blog’s and social marketing efforts online are up to date. Anytime I need help on a new task she is there ready and waiting. She is dedicated to my work and does an absolutely fantastic job. I know that I am also making a difference to her life as she is a single Mum with a daughter. So knowing that I am supporting her to be able to work professionally from home and be there for her daughter is a good feeling. </p>

<p>She is online each day with Skype and email and Remote Staff keep track of her work and hours all on my behalf. It took me about two weeks to settle in with having her set-up and now she pretty much runs a lot of my work. I actually feel a lot freer again and have more time for my kids and more time to sleep.

<p>Just thought I let you know that we have been working very closely with Rhiza, Remote staff Client support and she has spent a lot of time helping our staff Sharon and us with installation of Software (Skype recording, dropbox) and troubleshooting various issues.</p>

<p>She has been a pleasure to work with, always available, patient and very friendly and helpful and I have no idea what we would have done without her support</p>!

<p>“I use a staff member from Remote Staff who’s currently in Taiwan, but who began working with me when she was in the Philippines. I also use a virtual assistant in Brisbane, and I am based in Perth with clients around Australia, in New Zealand, the US, the UK and South Africa. I am a truly global business!</p>

<p>When launching Home Biz Chicks I knew that I would require virtual assistance as I was three months pregnant. I wanted to ensure that service for members continued smoothly when I went on maternity leave (Sept 09). I also didn’t want the hassle of hiring staff and dealing with staff issues – plus I work from home so can’t cater for staff to be physically located with me. I also had trouble finding suitable contractors in Australia who were affordably priced. My main need was for help with online services as the majority of products and services are virtual – so I needed a hand with e-newsletters, web site maintenance and web page creation. I came across Remote Staff at a networking event, and have been pleasantly surprised by the service. I was able to go on maternity leave knowing the business would continue to operate without me and with no high overheads.</p>
<p>
I had never considered using a virtual assistant from overseas before hand, but the price and professionalism afforded by Remote Staff made it a ‘no brainer’. My assistant, Kim, began with me in June of 2009. During that time she moved to Taiwan for studies and will return to the Philippines soon. The fact that she was able to move countries, while continuing to provide a great service for me was fantastic. I didn’t have to worry about losing her and then finding someone else. We can continue to operate together no matter where we are in the world – as long as you have an internet connection. “</p>

<p>“We have tried many design companies but they are expensive and slow. Since we have a full time designer with remotestaff.com.au now things have been moving a lot faster for us and we have been able to hire more staff in our Australian office. We have big plans over 2010 which includes hiring both more onsite employees and remote staff employees like programmers and a SEO manager with remotestaff.com.au.“</p>

<p>“Since engaging a telemarketer with RemoteStaff.com.au in November 2008, and after training one of its outsourced staff, Ness Consulting has built a sales pipeline totalling $2.3M for one of its clients; a great result given that this results come within the traditionally slower festive season.</p>

<p>Very happy with the solid controls put in place by RemoteStaff to ensure a positive outsourced staffing experience. My staff work together with me on a day to day basis and the experience is just like having the staff working from the next room, rather than in another country. “</p>

<p>“I couldn’t afford to pay $45,000 to hire someone to answer the basic questions in a call centre capacity for my business. I was trying to save cost by employing Uni students but they didn’t want the work so I looked for other staffing options. I came across remotestaff.com.au and found for a fraction of the price (Approximately 12k a year) I was able to hire someone overseas who doesn’t have the same opportunities that we take for granted, she was hard-working, diligent and very friendly to our customers at levels you seldom see in customer service these days.“</p>
<p>“Bringing my VA (Virtual assistant) on board has allowed me to sell my CV writing service and offer a better employment service to my clients, in turn helping more Australians get employed. Thanks to my assistant I have more time to focus on marketing and increasing my brand awareness whilst my remotestaff employee holds the fort and deals with all the calls and questions. The feedback I’ve received from my clients about my assistant has been fantastic!“

<p>“I just transitioned from another outsourcing company that placed with me a legal assistant that supposedly had 3 years of experience and I was paying twice the price of what it being charged by Remote Staff . Remote Staff placed with me a far superior assistant who not only has greater abilities to the other outsourcing company's staff member, but the Remote Staff member has superior language skills to those of many of the local job applicants. Keep up the good work! </p>

<h2 class="case1">CASE STUDY 1</h2>


<p>A client had a million-dollar idea for a product but literally no workforce to help him build momentum for his business and hiring locally just added to many constraints to his cash flow.  After he used Remote Staff to source staff to fill key positions in his organization, his profits quickly climbed until he hit and even exceeded his sales goal of a million dollars. By adding the remote staff resource, he achieved spectacular business growth.</p>

<!-- POINT 2 -->
<div id="clientpoints">
<div id="cases"  style="background:#dce7f0;">
<h2 class="case2">CASE STUDY 2</h2>
<p>A particular client has a web developer called “The Magician”. This web developer knows how to do just about anything online! The client has other IT staff in-house, some of the local staff are paid over $90,000 per year but none are as capable as this offshore remote staff person contracted at only $1,700 per month or $20,400 per year. Because of the skill and reliability of “The Magician”, the client is considering sponsoring him to work from Melbourne, Australia at a cost of $78,000 per year or $6,500 per month, a major increase but one the client sees as truly worthwhile.</p>

<!-- POINT 3 -->

<div id="cases" style="background:#e9f0f5;">
<h2 class="case3">CASE STUDY 3</h2>
<p>A client, who is one of the top 100 fastest growing companies in Australia, sees tremendous value in the Remote Staffing solution. He has decided to fly his two Philippines based Cisco specialists to train and meet with their in-house team so when they return to the Philippines they can play more of a key role within their organization. The experience has been so beneficial the client has decided to invest in bringing another 2 staff, but this time he wants the staff to work from Australia as part of his local team. </p>
