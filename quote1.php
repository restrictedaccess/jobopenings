<p class="text05">&quot;<em>Small businesses are starting to take advantage of cheap overseas labour by outsourcing work such as marketing, web design and office administration. Budding entrepreneurs say that thanks to the internet, they have been able to source white collar workers from overseas at a significantly lower cost than in Australia.</em>&quot;</p>

<p class="text05">&ldquo;<em>RemoteStaff.com.au searched and found me an an offshore professional assistant to work remotely with me, who met my criteria based on my job description I gave to them.  I can tell you it was the best thing I have done. Now my remotestaff assistant puts my videos live on the website, does my SEO work on the website and is teaching me things along the way as well. All my websites, blog’s and social marketing efforts online are up to date. Anytime I need help on a new task she is there ready and waiting.  She is dedicated to my work and does an absolutely fantastic job.  I know that I am also making a difference to her life as she is a single Mum with a daughter. So knowing that I am supporting her to be able to work professionally from home and be there for her daughter is a good feeling. <br />
<br />
She is online each day with Skype and email and Remote Staff keep track of her work and hours all on my behalf.  It took me about two weeks to settle in with having her set-up and now she pretty much runs a lot of my work.  I actually feel a lot freer again and have more time for my kids and more time to sleep.

<p class="text05">&ldquo;<em>I use a staff member from Remote Staff who’s currently in Taiwan, but who began working with me when she was in the Philippines.  I also use a virtual assistant in Brisbane, and I am based in Perth with clients around Australia, in New Zealand, the US, the UK and South Africa.  I am a truly global business!<br><br>

When launching Home Biz Chicks I knew that I would require virtual assistance as I was three months pregnant.  I wanted to ensure that service for members continued smoothly when I went on maternity leave (Sept 09).  I also didn’t want the hassle of hiring staff and dealing with staff issues – plus I work from home so can’t cater for staff to be physically located with me.  I also had trouble finding suitable contractors in Australia who were affordably priced. My main need was for help with online services as the majority of products and services are virtual – so I needed a hand with e-newsletters, web site maintenance and web page creation.   I came across Remote Staff at a networking event, and have been pleasantly surprised by the service.   I was able to go on maternity leave knowing the business would continue to operate without me and with no high overheads.<br><br>

I had never considered using a virtual assistant from overseas before hand, but the price and professionalism afforded by Remote Staff made it a ‘no brainer’.  My assistant, Kim, began with me in June of 2009.  During that time she moved to Taiwan for studies and will return to the Philippines soon.  The fact that she was able to move countries, while continuing to provide a great service for me was fantastic.  I didn’t have to worry about losing her and then finding someone else.  We can continue to operate together no matter where we are in the world – as long as you have an internet connection.  </em>&ldquo;</p>

Very happy with the solid controls put in place by RemoteStaff to ensure a positive outsourced staffing experience. My staff work together with me on a day to day basis and the experience is just like having the staff working from the next room, rather than in another country. </em>&ldquo;</p>

I was trying to save cost by employing Uni students but they didn’t want the work so I looked for other staffing options. I came across remotestaff.com.au and found for a fraction of the price (Approximately 12k a year) I was able to hire someone overseas who doesn’t have the same opportunities that we take for granted, she was hard-working, diligent and very friendly to our customers at levels you seldom see in customer service these days.</em>&ldquo;</p>

					<p class="text05"><em>&quot;I have to confess I have been unbelievably impressive working as a sub contractor with Remote Staff. Not to be a suck-up (excuse my term) but REALLY..my Remote Staff experience is just the most satisfying job experience I have ever had. I never experienced a delay with my payroll which is the very,very important. The in-house staff are very (virtually) approachable, totally an open-door management policy.<br>
<br>


Having a VA job seems to be an unfulfilling job for some because you just got to stay home and sit in front of your computer, click that mouse, type something, call someone to sell something..It's true I get to do all that (not yet on hard core selling though) but it's not at all unfulfilling or a no-brainer. In fact, it's challenging and if you think you need a "chill-ax"(slang: chill-relax) job then Remote Staff is not for you..Basically the whole scenario is..This job is your typical work in the corporate world or call center industry but you just don't get to travel long hours to get to your job because it's right there, within an arm's reach..All I am saying is..work standards should not diminish when you get a REMOTE STAFF job..In fact, you should even find more ways to "schmack (is that an actual word?!) yourself in the face" and motivate yourself to meet or go beyond your client's expectations. Your client has a business to run and most of the time you will be left on your own..And that is were the dilemma starts..when you are alone..what will you do? "sleep" on the job? or have the integrity to live up to the work standards you claim you possess during your job interview?&quot;</em></p>

More importantly, they truly do care about our success, and that is the most value of all. They are reliable and task oriented, exactly what you want in a staff person.
