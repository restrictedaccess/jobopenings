<p><em>IF FACE TO FACE INTERACTION WITH CO-WORKERS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU, WORKING FROM HOME MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT FIT FOR YOU.</em></p>

 Meeting people face to face can bring about new ideas, improve social skills, inspire and even develop fresh relationships.

Try to always find workarounds to mitigate these situations so that you can ensure that the momentum and working relationship you built with your international client won't get disrupted.</li>
